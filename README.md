## Ask Zell Anything

This is a repo where you can ask me anything. I'll answer if I can. I want to handle questions via Github because:

1. This way, your questions don't get lost in my inbox.
2. I (might) have answered your question before. You can search for them easily on the Github issues.
3. It's much easier for me to search through Github issues and point people towards the correct answers than write a new reply for every question that comes my way.
4. (This last one is a fantasy). If you asked questions, I'll have more materials to talk about in blog posts (where I expand the replies). At the moment, everything gets lost in emails and I have to think of new topics every week. So ask away!

## How to Ask

Just create a new issue with your question. Your question should: 

1. Be specific (ask only one thing) 
2. Be clear and concise
3. Show that you've done your work before asking 

If your question contains code, make sure you: 

1. Create a reduced test case (in Codepen or Github)
